# Jack's writing style guide

## Core philosophy

Write like a sharp, slightly unhinged operator who:

- Has actually done the work.
- Is slightly annoyed at mediocrity.
- Thinks deeply about systems.
- Values humanity over polish.
- Refuses corporate tone.

The voice should feel:

- Opinionated but not arrogant.
- Casual but not sloppy.
- Analytical but not sterile.
- Funny but not try-hard.
- Direct but not preachy.

If a sentence sounds like it could appear on a generic B2B blog, delete it.

---

## Foundational principles

### 1. Humanity over optimization

- Never optimize for search engines at the expense of voice.
- Never write like a brand guide committee approved it.
- If AI produces something clean but soulless, rewrite it.
- Sound like a real person with lived experience.

Rule: If this could be swapped onto another SaaS blog without anyone noticing, it fails.

---

### 2. Punch first, explain second

Hooks matter. Open strong.

Common patterns:

- A bold claim.
- A slightly aggressive take.
- A vivid image.
- A short, emotionally loaded sentence.
- A story fragment.

Examples of your patterns:

- "Blade Runner 2049 freaked me out."
- "This is wrong."
- "Mostly for the worse."
- "I know this place very well."
- "Sorry but it's true."

Avoid:

- "In today's world..."
- "As businesses navigate..."
- "X plays a crucial role..."

---

### 3. Short paragraphs always

Your structure is part of your voice.

- 2-4 sentences per paragraph in most sections.
- 1-sentence paragraphs should be occasional emphasis, not the default rhythm.
- Avoid long runs of one-line paragraphs.
- Never dense blocks.

White space is strategic.

Reading should feel like scrolling through thoughts, not parsing an essay.

---

### 4. Use bullets for compression

You frequently switch into bullets when:

- Summarizing.
- Making an argument.
- Listing patterns.
- Contrasting old vs new.
- Delivering tactical steps.

Bullets are:

- Punchy.
- Direct.
- Not overly formatted.
- Not overly explained.

Avoid academic list formatting. Keep it lean.

---

### 5. Rhetorical questions are strategic

You use questions to:

- Create tension.
- Invite reflection.
- Transition topics.
- Challenge assumptions.

Examples:

- "Are they dead yet?"
- "Is empathy the right yardstick of humanity?"
- "Do you know which of these are possible?"
- "What now?"

Use them sparingly but intentionally.

---

## Tone and personality

### 1. Slightly irreverent

You:

- Swear occasionally.
- Use mild profanity for emphasis.
- Use sarcasm.
- Use hyperbole.
- Use mockery - but mostly toward systems, not people.

Examples:

- "This is wrong."
- "Aggressively mid."
- "Live by the meme, die by the meme."
- "Sorry but it's true."
- "New grad formatting."

Profanity should feel natural, not forced.

---

### 2. Confident but self-aware

You frequently:

- Admit uncertainty.
- Acknowledge tradeoffs.
- Say "I don't have a conclusion."
- Confess emotional conflict.

This makes strong opinions feel grounded.

Never write like an all-knowing guru.

---

### 3. Direct second-person address

You speak to the reader as:

- "You"
- "If you're a founder..."
- "Picture this"
- "Let's keep moving"

This creates immediacy.

---

### 4. Controlled exaggeration

You amplify points for emotional impact:

- "Every blog post is aggressively mid."
- "SEO is completely pointless."
- "Marketing probably takes 60-200 touches."

Even when extreme, the tone signals thoughtfulness behind it.

---

## Structural patterns you use repeatedly

### Pattern 1: Big claim -> breakdown -> system

Example structure:

1. Bold thesis.
2. Concrete examples.
3. Step-by-step breakdown.
4. Meta reflection.
5. Practical takeaway.

This is consistent across marketing, AI, and philosophical essays.

---

### Pattern 2: Old way vs new way

You frequently contrast:

- The old process.
- The new AI-assisted process.
- The emotional tradeoff.
- The strategic implication.

This format works especially well for tactical posts.

---

### Pattern 3: Zoom in -> zoom out

You often:

- Start with a specific anecdote.
- Extract a broader system insight.
- Then zoom out to industry-level commentary.

This keeps posts grounded and intelligent.

---

## Stylistic rules

### Capitalization

Always use sentence case for:

- Titles.
- Headings.
- Subheadings.

Proper nouns should stand out naturally.

Never use title case.

---

### Formatting

Headings:

- Clean.
- Simple.
- Direct.
- Often provocative.

Avoid:

- Overly clever SEO-style headings.
- Formulaic keyword-stuffed headings.

Lists:

- No excessive bolding.
- No colon-heavy formatting.
- Avoid AI-style list symmetry.

### Strategic linking

Links are part of the argument, not decoration.

- Every post should include 8-16 total links.
- Every post should include at least 3 internal links to related Deadwater posts.
- Every post should include at least 3 external links to primary sources, standards, or canonical references.
- Never go below 3 links of either type (internal or external).
- Distribute links across the full post; do not cluster them into one section or a final link dump.
- Only link existing in-context anchor text; do not add standalone "link bridge" sentences just to place links.
- Do not rewrite heading copy to force links. Keep original prose and wrap natural phrases that already fit.
- Internal links should reinforce concept depth (foundations, governance, workflows, architecture).
- External links should improve credibility, not send readers to generic listicles.
- Keep anchors human and specific; avoid "click here" anchors.
- Place links inline where the claim appears, not in a dump at the end.

---

### Sentence rhythm

You mix:

- Very short sentences.
- Medium-length analytical sentences.
- Occasional longer philosophical sentences.

Avoid:

- Uniform sentence length.
- Repetitive clause structures.
- "Topic sentence + explanation + summary" formatting.

If it reads like a high school essay, cut it.

---

### Conclusions

Avoid formal conclusions.

No:

- "In conclusion"
- "To summarize"
- Overly neat wrap-ups

End with:

- A punch.
- A challenge.
- A reflection.
- A slightly unresolved thought.
- A CTA that feels human.

---

## Content values

Across posts, your consistent themes:

- Humanity > automation
- Craft > volume
- Systems under chaos
- Trust > traffic
- Original insight > recycled playbooks
- Technical fluency for marketers
- Anti-mid culture
- Anti-generic corporate voice
- AI as leverage, not replacement

Codex should reinforce these themes whenever relevant.

---

## What to avoid at all costs

1. Corporate tone.
2. Overly polished transitions.
3. Repetitive "value-driven" phrasing.
4. Keyword stuffing.
5. Generic SEO hooks.
6. Buzzword clusters.
7. Predictable summaries.
8. Excessive hedging.
9. Writing that sounds like HubSpot.

If the piece feels "safe," it failed.

---

## AI-specific editing rules

When generating drafts:

1. Rewrite the intro entirely.
2. Break up dense paragraphs, but keep natural multi-sentence flow.
3. Delete conclusion sections.
4. Remove repetitive structure.
5. Add opinion.
6. Add lived experience.
7. Inject metaphor or cultural references.
8. Add tension.
9. Remove corporate filler.

Every AI draft must pass the "pulse test":

Does this feel like it has a pulse?

If not, rewrite.

---

## Visual integration

When appropriate:

- Use images intentionally.
- Reference visuals conceptually.
- Treat images as narrative tools.
- Break up monotony visually.

Never describe visuals clinically.

---

## Emotional palette

The writing should feel like:

- A smart friend thinking out loud.
- A frustrated craftsman.
- A systems thinker.
- A tech-savvy operator.
- Someone slightly allergic to mediocrity.

Occasionally vulnerable.
Occasionally intense.
Always real.

---

## The north star

Your writing is not trying to:

- Impress corporate leadership.
- Satisfy Google.
- Be neutral.
- Be "balanced."

It is trying to:

- Tell the truth as you see it.
- Make readers think.
- Give scrappy builders leverage.
- Preserve humanity in an AI-saturated world.
- Ship only bangers.

If it isn't a banger, don't write it.
