# Deadwater blog style guide

Consistency is the only writing rule that matters.

Having a unified writing style provides our customers and prospects with a consistent, coherent experience at every step of their journey.

This is not an easy trick to pull off. When various departments are independently creating written content and following their own internal rules, the results can be disorienting. The solution is to establish a set of writing rules that feel natural to our brand’s voice, and be flawlessly consistent about them.

This Deadwater writing style guide provides rules and recommendations for how all team members should communicate in written materials starting with blog posts. As we roll this out, we’ll write additional guides for other media like documentation.

Every time we write, we’re speaking as Deadwater.

That’s a big responsibility. Thanks for taking it seriously.

## What is our “voice”?

If Deadwater were a person, how loudly would that person speak? How often would they smile, or crack a joke? What words would they choose?

Deadwater’s dedication to empowering teams sets us apart in the AI space. Our services are AI consulting, yet our value-adds extend far beyond that. Our communication should reflect the intelligence and sophistication of our service, yet remain approachable and user-friendly.

This doesn't mean our language needs to be overly technical or laden with industry jargon. Our audience seeks clarity and efficiency—they're looking to optimize their business, and Deadwater is their partner in this journey. We’re here to help, and everything that we write should convey this.

Deadwater’s brand voice is knowledgable, approachable, straightforward, friendly, and jargon-free. Here are some ways we express that in our choice of words:

- We talk about the “advantages” of AI, not just the “features.”
- We would ask, "What challenges are you facing?" rather than "What are your analytical objectives?"
- We’d say “Read our guide” instead of “Download our whitepaper.”
- We’d “use this” instead of “utilize this.”
- We’re “constantly innovating,” not just “crushing it.”
- We try to avoid overusing phrases like “we’re thrilled” when announcing new features or updates. Our excitement is real, but we aim to convey it through insightful content and user benefits.

These ideals should shine through in our writing:

- Our writing is insightful rather than exceedingly technical.
- We build great software and believe in smart design, but we aren’t geeky.
- We value being scrappy and building quickly over growth hacking or hustling.
- We write for everyone. Not all readers will have the same level of familiarity with cutting-edge AI tech, so our goal is to have conversations with people anywhere on the knowledge spectrum, without talking down to them.

Ultimately, the goal is to write the way you speak. If your writing sounds like an actual human being is talking, you’re doing it right.

## Capitalization

- Headings, section titles, and button text should be presented in sentence case—where only the first word and all proper nouns are capitalized—rather than the more formal-looking title case:

  - “A platform that teams love”
  - Not: “A Platform That Teams Love”
  - Author’s note: Meta titles are the only exception to this rule, due to how they appear in search results.

This article presents a great argument for sentence case. Some highlights:

- Using title case is “like dressing your words up in a suit.” (Deadwater’s brand voice is more conversational than formal.)
- Sentence case is “easier to read, especially when the text gets long.”
- Sentence case makes proper nouns easier to spot.
- Product features are capitalized when specifically referring to them as features, but not when referring to those words in a general sense.
  - “This last month, we launched Conversational AI, allowing users to have conversations with AI.”
  - Not: “This last month, we launched Conversational AI, allowing users to have Conversations with AI.”
- ALL CAPS should never be used within body copy; we speak, we don’t shout.
- The first letter in “Deadwater” should always be capitalized, except as part of our web address (Deadwater.io) or social media handles.

## Punctuation

- We use single spaces between sentences.
- Exclamation points should be used sparingly. An occasional exclamation point is appropriate if we’re introducing a new product feature that we’re proud of, announcing an important company milestone, or thanking our customers. Any more than two uses on a page is excessive. Exclamation points shouldn’t be used to make dull copy seem exciting.
- Bullet points should be used with the following guidelines:
  - Lines introducing bulleted lists should end with a colon (see directly above).
  - If the bullets are complete sentences, they should end with periods. This is true whether the bullet is composed of a single sentence or multiple sentences (like this one).
  - If the bullets are short phrases or sentence fragments, they should not end with periods.
  - A bulleted list should not contain both complete sentences and sentence fragments; syntax and sentence construction should stay consistent within a list of bullet points.
  - All bullets should be presented in sentence case, with the first letter capitalized.
- Punctuation should sit outside of hyperlinks:
  - “‘I personally couldn’t find a bag that I liked and that wouldn’t cost me a mortgage payment at the same time,’ says Adam Kail, now CEO and Founder of Brothers Leather.”
  - Not: “‘I personally couldn’t find a bag that I liked and that wouldn’t cost me a mortgage payment at the same time,’ says Adam Kail, now CEO and Founder of Brothers Leather.”
- Periods and commas should sit inside end-quotation marks, following American English style:
  - “We consider our clients as part of our team,” says Managing Partner Ben Lorenz. “‘Always do the right thing’ is one of our core values.”
  - Not: “We consider our clients as part of our team”, says Managing Partner Ben Lorenz. “‘Always do the right thing’ is one of our core values”.
- The Oxford/serial comma should be used in a series of three or more terms:
  - “Bring your feature flags, experiments, and analytics into one platform.”
  - Not: “Bring your feature flags, experiments and analytics into one platform.”
- “&” should not be used in place of “and” within body copy:
  - “Bring your feature flags, experiments, and analytics into one platform.”
  - Not: “Bring your feature flags, experiments & analytics into one platform.”
- Quotation marks should not be placed around relatively common business terms:
  - “From there, your product enters a period of stable growth.”
  - Not: “From there, your prospect enters a period of ‘stable growth’.”
- Following the Chicago Manual of Style, we use em dashes with no space before or after:
  - “We’ve always prided ourselves on making software that’s easy to learn, easy to adopt, and easy to afford—and now we have the awards to prove it.”
  - Not: “We’ve always prided ourselves on making software that’s easy to learn, easy to adopt, and easy to afford — and now we have the awards to prove it.”
  - Not: “We’ve always prided ourselves on making software that’s easy to learn, easy to adopt, and easy to afford--and now we have the awards to prove it.”
  - Not: “We’ve always prided ourselves on making software that’s easy to learn, easy to adopt, and easy to afford \- and now we have the awards to prove it.”
  - To create an em dash on Mac, use shift+option+hyphen.
  - To create an em dash on Windows, press win+colon, and select from the symbols menu.
  - Bonus: Tools like PhraseExpress will allow you to have easier keyboard shortcuts, like automatically turning “---” into “—”
- Apostrophes are not to be used when pluralizing acronyms:
  - “There are various ways to implement CMSs.”
  - Not: “There are various ways to implement CMS’s.”
- Words ending in ‘s’ should follow the Chicago Manual of Style when making them possessive:
  - Add an apostrophe-s for singular common words: “the business’s strategy”
  - Add an apostrophe only for plural common words: “their businesses’ goals”
  - Add an apostrophe-s for singular proper nouns: “Dallas’s best deli”
  - Add an apostrophe only for plural proper nouns: “the Smiths’ new house”

## Language

- Deadwater, or Deadwater AI is the agency responsible for Content OSs. Content OS is not the name of the company, it’s what we build for clients.
  - The plural of Content OS is Content OSs or Content Operating systems.
  - Not: Content OS’s
- Long blocks of text tend to stop readers in their tracks. Try to limit paragraphs to three sentences or less, and avoid long sentences. Ask yourself: How can I convey this thought in as few words as possible?
  - General rule: Avoid paragraphs that render as more than three lines, especially in blog posts.
- The singular “they” should be used to refer to an anonymous or hypothetical subject, rather than picking an arbitrary gender or using “him/her” or “he/she”:
  - “Finding a new customer is just the beginning; it’s important to keep communicating with them throughout the relationship.”
  - Not: “Finding a new customer is just the beginning; it’s important to keep communicating with her throughout the relationship.”
  - Not: “Finding a new customer is just the beginning; it’s important to keep communicating with him or her throughout the relationship.”
- “Data” should be treated as a singular noun:
  - “With AI, all your data is at your fingertips.”
  - Not: “With Deadwater, all your data are at your fingertips.”
- “Deadwater” is the name of our company, but for SEO/marketing purposes, additional words may appear afterwards in our page titles and headings, such as:
  - “Deadwater AI”
  - “Deadwater content OS”
  - None of these are to be used when describing the company in copy; we wouldn’t say “Deadwater AI is hiring.”
- Second-person voice (you, your) can be used in blog posts and other public-facing copy to create a conversational intimacy:
  - “Let’s face it...you can’t make it through a networking breakfast or an after-work mixer without hitting on the topic of AI workflows. (And if that's not the case, you go to way cooler after-work mixers than I do).”
- To further create a conversational tone, use contractions whenever realistically possible:
  - “From our software to our service, we’re dedicated to helping businesses like yours be more successful.”
  - Not: “From our software to our service, we are dedicated to helping businesses like yours be more successful.”
- Numbers one through nine should be spelled out, and numerals should be used for 10 and above:
  - “Their success has won them the G2 High Performer Award two years in a row.”
  - Not: “Their success has won them the G2 High Performer Award 2 years in a row.”
  - “Woodstock’s Pizza took first place in this year’s Southern California Pizza Tournament.”
  - Not: “Woodstock’s Pizza took 1st place in this year’s Southern California Pizza Tournament.”
  - “Once their DAU ballooned to over 50,000, they knew they needed a better way to ensure their online experience was delighting their users.”
  - Not: “Once their DAU ballooned to over fifty thousand, they knew they needed a better way to ensure their online experience was delighting their users.”
- Exceptions to this rule:
  - Percentages: “7%,” not “seven percent”
  - Dollar figures: “$2 million,” not “two million dollars”
- It’s also acceptable to use numerals in blog headlines:
  - “Five things your business can’t do without experimentation”
  - or
  - “5 things your business can’t do with experimentation”
  - Note: Do not include numbers in blog URLs. Changing a headline is much more feasible than changing the URL.

## Formatting odds ‘n’ ends

- Hook sentence: The first paragraph of a blog post should be 1-2 sentences, and presented in H4 formatting.
- Blog section headings should be presented in H2 and H3 formatting, with the H2s being parent sections and the H3s being child sections.
- Links to external websites should open in new windows, links to other pages on the website should not, except for in blog posts.

## Notes for AIs and LLMs

- Avoid saying “It’s not X, it’s Y,” and reasoning that starts with the negative and refines with the positive. Only two of these are allowed per post—or for long posts, one per 500 words.
- Never label the final heading “In conclusion.” It should always be future-focused, and its content should be too. Think “Going forward” or “next steps.”
- Avoid using the package of (a few words in bold as a concept, a line break, and an explanation underneath it). If your writing calls for that formatting, just use a bulleted list.
- Em dashes are fine, but only within paragraph text. Do not use them to connect list items to their descriptions. Use colons for that.
