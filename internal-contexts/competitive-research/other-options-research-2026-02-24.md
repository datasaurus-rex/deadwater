# Other options research and positioning (2026-02-24)

## Why this exists

Internal reference for how to position Deadwater against adjacent options in the market, without framing it as a hostile "competitors" page.

This supports an "other options" content track and future `/other-options/` public pages.

## Core framing

Deadwater's value props should be framed as the value props of a context-heavy AI system, with one crucial distinction:

- We install it for the client.
- We operationalize it in their stack.
- We hand over a governed system, not just access to a tool.

## Market categories

1. AI content workflow platforms
- AirOps
- Jasper
- Copy.ai

2. Enterprise context/governance platforms
- Writer
- Glean
- Notion AI / enterprise search

3. Composable content infrastructure
- Contentful
- Sanity

4. General automation layers
- Zapier
- Make

5. Agency alternatives
- AI/growth consultancies that provide strategy + implementation services

## What these options do well

- Template libraries and fast initial setup
- Integrations/connectors
- Better governance narratives than first-wave AI tools
- Faster activation than custom engineering from zero

## Common gaps (Deadwater opening)

- Platform-first orientation, not installed operating-layer orientation
- Context often handled as uploaded assets and prompts instead of a durable, structured substrate
- Heavy implementation burden still sits with the buyer
- Cross-workflow reliability and long-term maintainability are inconsistent
- Many services optimize campaigns, not durable context architecture

## Value props by Deadwater offer

### Workflow build

- Fast path to value on one bottleneck
- Fixed scope and clear input/output contract
- Reduced execution risk through QA and handoff
- Practical ROI proof before broader system investment

### Content OS install

- Compounding leverage across many workflows
- Reliable execution through schema, guardrails, and validation
- Portable architecture (code + markdown + git), minimizing lock-in risk
- Institutional knowledge becomes machine-operable
- Strategic ownership of AI operating infrastructure

## Recommended public narrative for "other options"

- Neutral and buyer-first: "here are your paths and tradeoffs"
- Compare by operating model, reliability, governance, and ownership
- Avoid attacking tools; explain fit by maturity and constraints
- Position Deadwater as "installed context-heavy system" rather than "another AI app"

## Suggested page architecture

- `/other-options/` hub page
- `/other-options/<solution>` compare pages
- Repeatable structure per page:
- "What it is"
- "Where it fits"
- "Where teams hit limits"
- "Deadwater Content OS comparison"
- "When to choose this option vs Deadwater"
