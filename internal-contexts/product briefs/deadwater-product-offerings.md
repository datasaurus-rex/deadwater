# Deadwater product offerings brief (internal)

Purpose: internal source of truth for blog drafting. Use this to keep product claims consistent with current About + Pricing pages.

## Positioning in one line

Deadwater builds AI-first Content OS platforms so companies can run reliable, governed, high-output content operations without prompt-glue chaos.

## Core problem Deadwater solves

- Most teams are doing "LLM copypasta": copy/paste loops with shallow context.
- Outputs drift from product reality and brand standards.
- Teams burn time on babysitting AI instead of using it as leverage.
- Legacy content stacks were built for human editing, not autonomous execution.

## Product model

Deadwater sells two implementation paths plus optional support.

### 1. Workflow build (Package A)

- What it is: targeted automation for a specific bottleneck.
- Price anchor: from `$22,000`.
- Typical timeline: `2-3 weeks`.
- Includes:
- 2 production-ready workflows (AirOps)
- input-output contract definition
- prompt + logic design
- QA + edge-case handling
- handoff docs + walkthrough
- Best for:
- competitive content
- SEO briefs/drafts
- research synthesis
- transcript-to-publishable workflows

### 2. Content OS install (Package B)

- What it is: full code-first content operating system.
- Price anchor: from `$50,000`.
- Typical timeline: `4-6 weeks`.
- Includes:
- code-based site/docs hub (no CMS dependency as source of truth)
- markdown + git-backed structure
- content schemas + folder conventions
- guardrails (validation, linting, safe execution patterns)
- AI execution hooks (Codex/Claude Code), documented
- module examples for SEO, competitive, internal context
- Best for:
- teams wanting compounding leverage
- teams avoiding tool lock-in
- teams with deep institutional knowledge
- Important constraint: framing is that Content OS can replace the website content system.

### 3. Ongoing support (optional)

- Price anchor: `$6,000-$12,000 / month`.
- Scope:
- new workflows and content types
- prompt/schema iteration
- integration/model/tooling upgrades
- quarterly cleanup/refactors

## About-page operating narrative

When writing, preserve this story arc:

1. AI-first platform with business-wide context.
2. Before/after contrast:
- Before: LLM copypasta, drift, inconsistency, shallow depth.
- After: governed Content OS, centralized context/behavior/publishing logic.
3. Use-case maturity:
- basic: daily production autopilot
- advanced: cluster/pipeline expansion
- extreme: strategic intelligence layer
4. Philosophy:
- AI is here to stay
- growth content sucks
- humans deserve humans
5. Mission:
- replace fragile, human-dependent processes with trustworthy AI-native systems

## High-confidence claims safe to reuse in posts

- Deadwater is code-first and system-first, not prompt-template-first.
- Goal is reliable execution, not one-off generation.
- Human effort is shifted toward strategy, POV, and high-leverage decisions.
- Deployments are stack-aware and scoped to business outcomes.
- Pricing and delivery are fixed-scope for predictable delivery.

## Claims to avoid unless explicitly sourced

- Specific customer performance metrics not published publicly.
- Guaranteed timeline language beyond "typical timeline."
- "Fully autonomous" promises without governance context.
- Tool-compatibility claims outside the listed integrations and general stack-aware wording.

## ICP and fit guidance for blog framing

Primary audience:

- founders and marketing leaders
- technical marketers and growth operators
- teams feeling pain from brittle AI content workflows

Best-fit signals to reference:

- active content motion already exists
- need consistency + velocity + governance
- willing to invest in systems, not hacks

Poor-fit signals:

- desire for cheap high-volume generic copy
- no clear owner of content operations
- no appetite for process/system changes

## Messaging style for product mentions inside blog posts

- Emphasize business consequence -> system cause -> system fix.
- Use "Content OS" as operating layer language, not just tooling language.
- Pair tactical examples with governance and reliability.
- Keep CTA framing practical: scoping call, demo, or architecture exploration.

## Preferred CTA language

- Book a scoping call
- Book a demo
- Explore Content OS
- Talk to Deadwater

## Writing workflow note for agents

Before finalizing a post:

1. Verify product references against this brief.
2. Ensure claims map to either Workflow build, Content OS install, or optional support.
3. Keep positioning aligned: leverage that compounds, not outsourced content labor.
